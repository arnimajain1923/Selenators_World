        <h2>Who are We ?</h2>
        <p>
          Who made this fan page? is likely the first question a fan would ask. The solution to that is that I am an engineering student, so let me give you that. I made this page as an internship project since I wanted to concentrate on something interesting rather than just copying and pasting.Â

        <h2>Why Selena Gomez Fanpage ?</h2>
        <p style="padding-right: 20px;">
          There is only one explanation for this and one response to that query: I adore her music and her a great deal and wanted to do something to express my affection for an artist who (like her most recent documentary film "my mind and me") inspires me in a variety of ways.
